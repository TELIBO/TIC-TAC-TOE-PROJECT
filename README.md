# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Hard AI

This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game with a hard AI player using the minimax algorithm.

## Features

- Human vs. AI gameplay
- AI opponent with hard difficulty level
- Command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TELIBO/TIC-TAC-TOE-PROJECT.git
    ```

2. Compile the Java code:

    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## AI Algorithm

The hard AI player uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves and is a challenging opponent.
